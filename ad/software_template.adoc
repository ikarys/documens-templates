== Component: User Management Microservice

=== Objective
The user management microservice handles user-related functionalities such as registration, login, and profile management.

=== Technologies Used
- Language: Python 3.8
- Framework: Flask
- Database: MySQL
- Authentication System: OAuth2

=== Architecture

==== Endpoints
1. `POST /users/register`: Registers a new user.
   - Receives user data, validates it, and stores it in the database.

2. `POST /users/login`: Authenticates an existing user.
   - Verifies credentials and generates an access token.

3. `GET /users/profile`: Retrieves the profile of the currently authenticated user.
   - Uses the access token to validate the user's identity.

==== Database
- "users" table storing user information (id, name, email, hashed password, etc.).

=== Data Flow

1. **User Registration:**
   - Input data: Name, email, password.
   - Processing: Data validation, password hashing, insertion into the database.

2. **User Login:**
   - Input data: Email, password.
   - Processing: Verification of credentials, generation of access token.

3. **Profile Retrieval:**
   - Input data: Access token.
   - Processing: Token validation, retrieval of user information.

=== Security
- Use of OAuth2 for secure authentication.
- Secure storage of passwords with hashing.

=== Scalability
- Horizontal scalability achieved through microservices design.

=== Points of Caution
- Error handling to ensure a robust user experience.
- Performance monitoring to maintain optimal response times.
