= Architecture Document

The Architecture Document (AD) is a comprehensive and structured record that outlines the technical architecture of a system, project, or software application. It serves as a critical reference for development teams, architects, and stakeholders, providing detailed insights into the design choices, components, and their interactions within the system.

== Purpose

The Architecture Document serves several essential purposes:

- **Technical Blueprint:** Acts as a technical blueprint, offering an in-depth overview of the system's architecture, including key components and structures.

- **Communication Aid:** Facilitates effective communication among development team members, ensuring a shared understanding of the technical landscape.

- **Decision Reference:** Serves as a reference for informed decision-making during the development lifecycle, providing insights into the rationale behind architectural choices.

== When to use an Architecture Document

The Architecture Document is particularly valuable in the following contexts:

- **System Architecture Overview:** Use the AD to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's technical architecture.

- **Collaborative Development:** When collaboration among team members is crucial, the AD facilitates a shared understanding of the technical landscape.

- **Decision Support:** Utilize the AD as a reference for decision-making related to technical components and their interactions.

Leverage the Architecture Document in these scenarios to enhance collaboration, provide clarity on technical architecture, and support informed decision-making.

== When NOT to use an Architecture Document

While the Architecture Document is a powerful tool, there are instances where it may not be the most suitable:

- **Detailed Project Descriptions:** The AD is not designed to outline overall project details; its focus is on the technical architecture specifics.

- **Non-Technical Aspects:** Avoid using the AD for documenting non-technical aspects or general project information.

- **Minor Implementation Choices:** If a decision is relatively minor and doesn't significantly impact the overall technical architecture, a detailed AD may be unnecessary.

In such cases, consider alternative documentation methods to maintain clarity and ensure that the Architecture Document is reserved for providing in-depth insights into the technical aspects of the system.
