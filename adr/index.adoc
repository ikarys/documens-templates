= Architecture Decision Record

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that record significant architectural decisions made during the design of a system. ADRs are used to document the reasons behind a decision, the alternatives considered, and the consequences of the decision.

== Purpose 

ADRs are useful for several reasons:

- They allow documentation of significant architectural decisions made during the design of a system.
- They facilitate communication among development team members.
- They assist in maintaining architectural consistency.

== When to Use an Architecture Decision Record

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) proves beneficial in various contexts:

. **Critical Architectural Choices:** ADRs are valuable for documenting significant architectural decisions made during the design phase.

. **Enhancing Team Communication:** When clear communication within the development team is essential, ADRs provide a structured way to convey the reasoning behind architectural decisions.

. **Preserving Architectural Cohesion:** ADRs play a role in maintaining consistency within the architecture, serving as a reference for adhering to established principles.

Utilize ADRs in these situations to improve collaboration, document crucial decisions, and uphold architectural integrity.

== When Not to Use an Architecture Decision Record

While Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are powerful tools, they may not be the most suitable in certain situations:

. **Project Descriptions:** ADRs are not intended for outlining overall project details. Instead, they are best suited for documenting specific and highly technical decisions within a project.

. **Non-Technical Matters:** ADRs are designed for capturing technical decisions. Avoid using them for non-technical aspects or general project information.

. **Minor Implementation Choices:** If a decision is relatively minor and doesn't significantly impact the overall architecture, using an ADR might be unnecessary.

In such cases, consider alternative documentation methods to avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure that ADRs are reserved for the appropriate technical decision-making scenarios.
