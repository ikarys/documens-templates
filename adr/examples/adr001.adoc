Accepted

== Context and Problem Statement

To streamline our project's domain naming, a decision on the DNS convention is imperative. The challenge is selecting a convention that not only accommodates project growth but also maintains a clear and manageable structure. As systems complexity rises, clarity in domain names becomes pivotal for seamless maintenance and evolution.

This decision is proposed to ensure a clear hierarchy and easy understanding of domain names.

. `environment-module-product.domain.com`
. `environment.module.product.domain.com`

== Consequences

- The chosen convention will influence the clarity and consistency of domain names within the project.
- The impact on ease of management and understanding of services will be evaluated.
