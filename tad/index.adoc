= Technical Architecture Document (TAD)

The Technical Architecture Document (TAD) is a comprehensive document that outlines the technical architecture of a system or project. It provides detailed insights into the technical choices, components, and their interactions, offering a holistic view of the technical landscape.

== Purpose

The TAD serves several essential purposes:

- **Technical Overview:** It offers a detailed technical overview of a system, highlighting its key architectural components and structures.

- **Communication Aid:** The TAD aids in effective communication among development team members, ensuring a shared understanding of the technical architecture.

- **Reference for Decision-Making:** It serves as a reference for making informed decisions regarding technical aspects during the development lifecycle.

== When to use a TAD

The Technical Architecture Document is particularly valuable in the following contexts:

. **System Architecture Overview:** Use the TAD to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's technical architecture.

. **Collaborative Development:** When collaboration among team members is crucial, the TAD facilitates a shared understanding of the technical landscape.

. **Decision Support:** Utilize the TAD as a reference for decision-making related to technical components and their interactions.

Leverage the TAD in these scenarios to enhance collaboration, provide clarity on technical architecture, and support informed decision-making.

== When NOT to use a TAD

While the Technical Architecture Document is a powerful tool, there are instances where it may not be the most suitable:

. **Detailed Project Descriptions:** The TAD is not designed to outline overall project details; its focus is on the technical architecture specifics.

. **Non-Technical Aspects:** Avoid using the TAD for documenting non-technical aspects or general project information.

. **Minor Implementation Choices:** If a decision is relatively minor and doesn't significantly impact the overall technical architecture, a detailed TAD may be unnecessary.

In such cases, consider alternative documentation methods to maintain clarity and ensure that the TAD is reserved for providing in-depth insights into the technical aspects of the system.
